CHANGES

4.0 --

* ST.add() returns self now so we can chain.  t.add("x", 1).add("y", "hi");
* import from files in jar didn't work.
* removed field tokens from STGroupString
* improved imports lookup
* made fields of events public final.
* augmented debug event toString and fixed start/stop issue with eval
  events.  renamed fields to be more clear.
* Added IndentEvent for dbg
* ^(INDENT expr-sub-tree) is now ^(INDENTED_EXPR INDENT expr-sub-tree)
  with changes to grammars.  More consistent with subtree root being operator.
  STViz now highlights indentation properly in template pane.
* Altered CodeGenerator.g to pass AST node for indentation not just string.
  This way we get INDENT operations into the sourceMap for indent debug events.

4.0b5 -- March 6, 2011

BIG THANKS to Sam Harwell and, again, to Udo Borkowski for debugging help and
suggestions. Sam is doing the C# implementation.  Benjamin Niemann is doing
the Python port. Alan Condit is doing Objective-C.

* true/false were only allowed as default args; now allowed as template
  arg expressions in templates. Works as dictionary value too.
* couldn't have anonymous templates inside a region.
* parentheses were a bit weird in conditions.  Now, conditions cannot
  use parentheses to mean "early evaluation" except as obj.(propName)
* nativeGroup of all implicit templates was STGroup.defaultGroup.
* removed all writes of the enclosingInstance at evaluation time; fixed
  issue for STViz.
* comments on line by themselves don't emit \n to output
* STViz tried to highlight AST pane even when we switched ASTs
* combined load_str, write into write_str single op. minor optimizations too.
  Seems a tiny bit faster per benchmarks.
* Added ST.VERSION auto-updated by ANT.
* added STGroupString
* Added support for this in group.g:
  oldStyleHeader // ignore but lets us use this parser in AW for both v3 and v4
    :   'group' ID ( ':' ID )?
	    ( 'implements' ID (',' ID)* )?
	    ';'
	;
* IndexOutOfBounds Exception when using "cap" format on empty string
* @t.() ::= "" caused NPE
* Region redefinition caused NPE. "<@r>a<@end><@r()>"
* STViz couldn't see first subtemplate when computing template range in output.
* Was incorrectly computing filename to load template .st files from group dir.
* Listener was not notified upon "no such template" in group dir.
* Redid how ST found imported files, dir, etc.. Can now import a template
  file even.  Can be absolute path or relative path.  If relative, it
  looks in dir of .stg file with import then CLASSPATH.
* The listener of import groups is now set to that of group that imports
  them.
* Regions behave like <if> tags now. Indent respected if <@r>...<@end> on
  indented single line.  Indent/newlines ignored after those tags if
  on separate lines.

4.0b4 -- February 5, 2011

BIG THANKS to Udo Borkowski for his help debugging these betas and his
suggestions.

* added write to file methods
* had infinite loop for expr: "<t()$"
* the default file encoding is now UTF-8
* early eval <(x)> using new STWriter derived from type of current STWriter.
  e.g., AutoIndentWriter.
* didn't detect nonterminated comment. <!bad comment>
* added two literals "true" and "false" to the template argument syntax; e.g.,
  stat(name,x=true,y=false) ::= "..."
* it was treating "..." default arg as a template not string.
* throws STException now upon not finding group file or group dir instead
  of sending err to listener.
* default args couldn't have subtemplates
  t(x,y={<x:{s|<s>}>}) ::= "..."
* Added a new benchmark from Oliver Zeigermann.

4.0b3 -- January 28, 2011

* exception in lexer blew out of parsing
* missing '}' in {...} caused infinite loop
* NPE in storeArgs if empty arg list
* removed debugging prints.
* x={<(...)>} default arg was hardcoded to <...> not $..$ or whatever.
* The grammar needed to match and ignore an optional INDENT before region @end
* when redefining a region (template) the newline before the >> was kept.
* WS not ignored in front of STRING token in expressions.
* closing STViz doesn't exit vm now.
* throws exception if registering renderer or model adaptor for primitive

4.0b2 -- January 22, 2011

* Order of static init issue; an error mgr was null.
* Fixed some unit testing the Windows friendly
* Fix bug in triple if-elseif-elseif-elseif; added unit tests
* bug where I did not say current_ip when calling exec() from writeObject
* Updated README to include install information

4.0b1 -- January 14, 2011
